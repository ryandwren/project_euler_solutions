# project_euler_solutions
Ryan's personal work book for project euler solutions.

## Why in Kotlin?
I specialize in Android development and I want to keep my skills sharp. Additionally these math questions don't use library specific functions so the language the solutions are written in doesnt matter too much.

## Why the user input?
A personal challenge. These questions are designed to make you solve math problems programmatically. By allowing user input I write these programs with a wider scope which increases the code part of each exercise and supports a certain mindset.
